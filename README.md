=======
Set as dir : /dir/Getdata/project assignment/all ,
in which you have the following files:
"X_test.txt ", "X_train.txt" , "features.txt", 
"y_test.txt" , "y_train.txt" , "activity_labels.txt" ,
"subject_test.txt" and "subject_train.txt"
Run_analysis.R reads the raw data,
merges all the txt files needed,
cuts off the useless Columns, 
gives proper names for the Columns,
and computes the average of each Variable
for each SubjectId and each Activity.
